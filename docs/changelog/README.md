# Daily Changelogs

This directory contains daily changelog files. Each file should be named with the date in `YYYY-MM-DD.md` format (e.g., `2023-10-27.md`).

These files serve as a granular record of changes made each day, which can then be summarized into the main `CHANGELOG.md` in the project root.
